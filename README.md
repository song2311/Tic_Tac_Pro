# Tic Tac Pro
Tic Tac Pro is a game involving a 10 x 10 grid (list of lists) which has the same goal as regular tic-tac-toe, that is to connect a sequence of crosses or circles in either a column, row or diagonal. 

## Goal of the game
The goal is to achieve a winning move by placing 5 pieces adjacent to each other either horizontally or vertically.


## Description of the game
 The difference is that in Tic -Tac-Pro, players must connect 5 in a row and that each team must complete 2 sequences to win a single game. Also, players method of input to play their moves is to input code that changes the index selected to either their cross or circle. Failure to input correctly will result in the loss of a turn. Additionally, there are several ‘power-ups’ in the form of list functions that can be performed only once per game. These include list.reverse, list.pop and list.clear. (cannot be applied to completed sequences). 

## Learning outcomes
From this game, players are able to learn how 2D arrays are implemented within Python and how it is useful to represent a tabular structure such as a Tic Tac Toe game.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required for the game to run in command line or terminal depending on the operating system :
```
python version 3.7
processing.py
```
